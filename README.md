Marvel coding test

I have tried to complete as much of this task as possible in the 3 hours given. Still outstanding are:
- Details screen with further information on each comic.
- Budget calculator
- Unit testing and error handling including edge cases.

I have used the following libraries:
- Picasso for image retrieval
- Retrofit for REST
- OkHTTp for logging
- Stringbuilder for runtime testing

Assumptions: That the price calculated is fine in USD rather than converting to GBP
